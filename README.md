 Hello , I’m @Neitikjangra 

⚡ About Me

I'm more than a programmer — I'm an intelligence builder.
From architecting web ecosystems to developing AI that learns and responds, I excel where logic, creativity, and strategy intersect.

What was once curiosity about "why things work" became a quest:
👉  to build technology that truly makes a difference.

🔥 What Drives Me

🤖 AI in Action → Bringing machine learning concepts to life (chatbots, predictive models, surveillance AI).

🌐 Full-Stack Vision → Building digital products where design, code, and user experience blend harmoniously.

📊 Data Alchemy → Transmuting raw databases into sleek, savvy backbones of applications.

⚽ Code + Football → Using game strategy for coding: anticipate, adapt, and execute with precision.
