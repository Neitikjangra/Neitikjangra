⚡ About Me

I'm more than a programmer — I'm an intelligence builder.
From architecting web ecosystems to developing AI that learns and responds, I excel where logic, creativity, and strategy intersect.

What was once curiosity about "why things work" became a quest:
👉  to build technology that truly makes a difference.
